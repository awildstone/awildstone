- 👋 Hi, I’m @awildstone
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, JavaScript, Java, and I'm wondering if I should learn C or C++? 🧐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about web frameworks. I just built my first app using Python and Flask SQLAlchemy, and now I am learning about Node.js and Express.
My first application I built is an app to help me manage the watering schedule for my plant collection and I want to improve it so that anyone who loves plants around the world can use it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web applications or other open source projects that aim to help people develop new skills or solve a problem. 
- 📫 How to reach me : send me an [email](mailto:awildstone@gmail.com) or find me on [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/awildstone/)
